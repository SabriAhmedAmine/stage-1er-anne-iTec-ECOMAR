2. **Configuration**:
   - Copy `wp-config-sample.php` to `wp-config.php` if not already present.
   - Edit `wp-config.php` to match your database credentials and settings.
3. **Web Server**:
   - Place the project folder in your web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP, `www` for WAMP).
   - Ensure your server supports PHP and MySQL.
4. **Access the Site**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/stage-1er-anne-iTec-ECOMAR/` (or your configured domain).
